Not only is Iger giving their 100+ years of historic content and IP away, they are paying to do it. Also, with AI replicating humans--there is an uncanny valley. No matter how good a Tom Cruise or Elon AI video is, you will eventually know it's AI generated. Not with animation. In only a couple months to years, you will never know if the short clip of Elsa or Buzz Lightyear is from an AI creation prompted by a 10 year old, or if it was actually made by the studio's animators. DIS is stupid for doing this. They're cooked."

Thinking about it behind the scenes with all the recent news. Netflix beating Paramounts bid on WBD and then Paramount beating Netflix is a sign that Larry Ellison really really wants CNN. Oracle will then make deals with Paramount since they are both co owned by Larry... This will all have to happen before the midterms next year so they can control more of the media.... its so obvious

If you have reserves on the side (lol in WSB) the setup isn’t bad to put a portion of that in at this price. The known catalysts will be 2/3/26 earnings and Gemini 3.5 model release in March 2026.   Don’t expect Waymo or TPU news or AI benchmarks to move the stock meaningfully.   If I were better at playing options I’d say consider GOOG 3/20 330c but I think it’s a bit too far out right now and thetagang will probably eat too much of your gains to be worth it.

Long term it’s unsustainable and short term it breeds delusion of safety. Very dangerous. FED needs to increase rates and reduce m2 supply while buying treasuries. This is a bandaid on an arterial wound.  The real problem is: massive fiscal deficits, excessive government debt issuance, duration mismatch in the banking system, and the long-term effects of artificially low rates.  Injecting liquidity again doesn’t solve that.  It just postpones it.  SPY 800 EOY"

This would mean the mine has been at a standstill which is nowhere in the stock news. If the standstill lasts roughly 30 days they would incur a loss of about 28 million dollars at spot price. Adding the cost of repair might bring it closer to 40 million dollar loss before insurance and tax write off. This is a heap leach operation (30-60 day bath) so they have stockpiles to sell but there will be a gold lag before the february earnings report regardless. Last quarterly net was reported as 147 million dollars. This represents \~30% loss in profit that no one seems to want to talk about. Today they are up 6%.

Broadcom is a key supplier in this boom, especially in designing custom chips and networking solutions for the world's largest AI companies.  if this fails. prepare anoos  Yes, Broadcom has several significant connections and deals with Oracle, spanning both their hardware and software businesses. These deals fall into two main categories:  1. 🤝 Strategic Partnerships and Mutual Suppliers    The relationship is primarily driven by how both companies operate in the enterprise IT space, with a major focus on cloud computing and AI infrastructure.     Broadcom itself is a large customer of Oracle. Following its major acquisitions, Broadcom adopted Oracle Cloud services, specifically using Oracle Sales, Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ), and DataFox Data Management software to manage its massive, diverse customer base and streamline its internal sales processes.    Hardware Interoperability: Broadcom (via its Emulex brand) and Oracle have long-standing product interoperability. Broadcom's Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) and other networking and storage components are designed and certified to work with Oracle's storage, servers, and networks, particularly for high-performance applications like Oracle Data Warehousing.    Software Solutions for Oracle Applications: Broadcom offers a suite of its own enterprise software (from its CA Technologies acquisition, now under the Broadcom banner) designed to help large companies run, test, and automate their core Oracle Applications (like Oracle E-Business Suite) more efficiently.

We now have a private and global market that sets the price rather than a stable exchange rate.  Your silver and gold certificates are now paper which is as good as a German Papiermark of the 1920s. As good as our military or trade ability.  As a new liberal world 100 years later no country actually wants to fight this militarily. China this has proven they won the real war, price stability and cheap export of goods to the world.   Their 1 trillion deficit with the US is the proof.

I think the best chess players in the world truly enjoy reading about it, practicing in simulations, adopting strategies and styles, practicing in low stakes simulations for months or years   They don’t envision the trophies or prize money, they truly just autistically love the game of chess and would probably be playing it even if there was no prize money at all   I think it’s also like dating. The more you chase and get overly emotional the worse things get.

It would incredibly strengthen NFLX business.  For WBD owners they get $23.25 cash plus $4.5 worth of NFLX shares (very undervalued) and shares of the new Discovery company.  With PSKY deal they only get $30 cash.  So for WBD owners it's much better to go with NFLX.  Now that admin is involved though I'm tempering my expectations.

Then many fund buyers are doing CBA and the short and short is they are buying the dirt cheap collateral to take price neutral dealing on the option market.  So the bug boys are literally paying Saylor to setup tables in his casino. And retail gambling in its highly volatile option market (and mainly losing lmao) are the target product.  Saylor himself goes in depth on how he has setup this financial system for some reason MSTR tards dont want to literally hear it from Saylor himself. Idk.

ntgkn96,BagHoldersOfAmerica,1,1765458360.0,2025-12-11 08:06:00,Gold and silver miners typically do not use longterm fixed price contracts they sell at spot because investors expect full exposure to metal prices and hedging has hurt miners in the past. The “rock washer” comment fits base-metal miners better than precious metal miners.  The big precious metal miners currently have very little hedging as of last report so lots of upside to capture

Credit markets showed signs of distress way before firms went belly up and market broke down.  Financial crisis like you said was unique. Even the smartest people didn't understand the extent to which risk was being amplified in the system.  Valuations were actually super fair and reasonable.

Firstly, in October, we announced OWL, our next-generation monitoring fleet, to continue our unique broad area monitoring mission currently serviced by the SuperDove fleet, but improving the resolution to one-meter class, lowering the latency, and significantly upgrading the onboard compute to incorporate NVIDIA GPUs. OWL is designed from the ground up to address expanded applications ranging from security to disaster response to rapid change detection. The first tech demo is slated for launch later in calendar year 2026, and we're incredibly excited about the future of our daily monitoring solutions. Secondly, we've recently announced a funded R&D initiative with Google called Project SunCatcher.  >Will Marshall  >CEO, Chairperson, and Co-Founder  >0:11:19  >SunCatcher aims to enable scaled AI computing in space by putting Google's Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, on purpose-designed satellites where they can leverage the energy of the sun and shed excess heat into the natural coldness of space. This was a competitive win for Planet, and our strong track record of building, launching, and operating over 600 satellites to date, together with our collaboration on AI-enabled solutions, represents a competitive edge underlying the depth of our experience and our Agile Aerospace approach. SunCatcher aligns well with our technology development roadmap for Owl, leveraging the same satellite bus and is therefore highly synergistic. As previously announced, we're planning to deploy two prototype satellites in early 2027. We're excited to be working with our long-term partner, Google, to develop this promising new technology."

There is arbitrage happening, shorts (banks who sell futures) being held to their obligations to deliver silver, edit: (opposed to settling in cash) along with retail participating in the supply shortage by scooping up physical and exacerbating the volatility.  Gold is behaving normally. Silver is being scooped up like there’s no tomorrow and the coming contracts leading up to March will likely continue the madness"

Walmart (shopping) Healthcare (LLY but Novo better priced). Music (Apple/Sony). Games (Sony/Microsoft)  Going forward, I then tend to look at entry points and cost per share compared to revenue/earnings . (EPS). Ubers is significantly higher meaning it’s a better entry point .   Then we look at futures. Uber has 2 main competitors. Google and Lyft .   Uber has partnered with Chinese AV makers to use there vehicles with Uber customers base , meaning no maintenance all profit.   Lyft has done similar.  Google has its own fleet to maintain with no customer base , which is why they have partnerships with Uber and Lyft.  Uber has no real threat competition. Making my point, looking at Netflix’s future, it’s all competition with many companies (Fubo, Disney, Comcast, etc). You’re betting against Disney by betting on Netflix in a way. Disney is Netflix but with more avenues of revenue , no point in buying a company with increasing competition and one means of revenue.   So uber wins on P/E, lack of competition, earnings, and future growth.   Netflix wins on.. well they’re just the market leader in streaming at a low entry point . I think big ole Disney will overtake Netflix in the long run. I mean common it’s Disney . Netflix just had a head start. Disney is already acquiring many streaming services (Hulu, Fubo). Netflix is trying to acquire WBD but it’s having a hard time and I think acquired some other stuff but I can’t remember .   Netflix growth is slowing while Ubers is growing (# of trips taken). Both are growing revenue wise but the actual percentage of growth is slowing with Netflix per year. (Correct me if I’m wrong there as I could be). Ubers has only slowed since pandemic but the # of trips taken increases per year.   Also even Google says Netflix has slowing customer growth and intense increasing competition. I still like the stock though just at a lower entry.   Also I do think movie theaters will come back with some virtual 5D / 4DxD or whatever da fk shet that will blow people away . You can’t buy that quality at home.   Just a matter of who does it first: Cinemark (on its way), Netflix Nah, Disney (on its way) , AMC (that’s a joke). Movie theaters will come back but under new guidance and expectations. It’ll be more like theme parks theaters than movie theaters.  Sorry it’s long but that’s my thoughts, I’m also sure a lot of that may be wrong ."

Despite what the benchmarks say, it hallucinates far more than the other 2 models, dare I say 3-5x as much.   Its memory is also horrendous, if your thread is longer than 15 prompts it will rapidly forget the context, whereas Claude and ChatGPT can remember 100 threads, not prompts.  It’s literally the TPUs. Sure it’s efficient and can do very well on single prompt benchmarks but if you actually use these models you will quickly see why Nvidia’s chips are so much better.  So unless Google decides to start using Nvidia chips, the benchmarks can only take them so far, the TPUs are always going to hold them back."

Even the biggest market cap miners have smaller market caps than a lot of small tech.  So the slightest amount of rotation into them can greatly influence stock prices unlike qqq
