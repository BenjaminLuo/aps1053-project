Their new “agents”, the ones that are supposed to automate multi-step tasks, aren’t taking off like they thought. Multiple teams actually missed their sales goals last year, so Microsoft had to dial back expectations across divisions.  And for Microsoft, that’s not normal. It basically means even they’re realizing this AI gold rush isn’t as real as Wall Street keeps pretending. If customers aren’t willing to pay for the “future of everything,” that says a lot. AI just isn’t ready, and the market is insanely overvalued for what we’re actually getting.  https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stock-futures-steady-after-wall-st-gains-on-fed-cut-bets-crypto-rebound-4387305"

How the best operate is they combine good luck with portfolio conservation. They know when their good luck is running out so they take breaks. Often after a winning streak they take a week off to not get sucked into MM flash crashes/flash gainers. The rest of us just play the market every day and we take the small wins and the catastrophic losses to go with them

ns2tuvi,Happy_Discussion_536,5,1764775216.0,2025-12-03 10:20:16,"Incredible wealth of information in the NY Fed Quarterly Household Credit Report that came out few days ago.  Highly recommend you read it.  Some interesting tidbits:  https://i.imgur.com/39QYN9G.png  Credit card delinquencies remain definitely elevated but there are signs of plateauing and leveling off.   Student loan delinquencies are literally mooning.  It seems people are saying fuck you, I'm not paying.  The good news on this is that nearly all loans are government backed so it shouldn't be a huge hit to the financial system.  Overall delinquencies are normalizing but still below pre-Covid and extremely healthy:  https://i.imgur.com/ONVBPC0.png  Foreclosures and bankruptcies, also super low:  https://i.imgur.com/E2D5iBf.png  Not surprisingly there is some bifurcation by age.  Older and wealthier are doing around pre-Covid levels.  There is definitely more credit struggle for GenZ and people in their 30s (light blue and red line):  https://i.imgur.com/2Y3SR4e.png  Overall?  I think very little cause for alarm in terms of the economy and stock market.  Fed will keep liquidity in the system high, credit available.  I expect QE3 coming soon as early as April, maybe more crumbs on details January (they will jawbone or provide little in December probably since not much data is available).  Holiday shopping was gangbusters and bullish.  Edit: Not in the credit report but some context on financial conditions.  Spreads remain extremely tight:  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1OpxJ&height=490  Lending continues to soar:  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1OpxZ&height=490  Financial conditions remain very loose:  https://i.imgur.com/PE4clw0.png"

A provision in last year's defense bill says that if no federal security agency completes a technical audit of DJl and Autel by December 23, the companies get pushed onto the FCC's ""Covered List."" That means no new imports, no new FCC certifications, and no new software updates for future models. Existing drones in service won't be confiscated, but the supply pipeline shuts off.”*"

ns2fslt,New_Ad_1682,1,1764770715.0,2025-12-03 09:05:15,"So my long term portfolio combines a buy and hold strategy with S and P 500 companies (80% or so anyway). Every day I look at S and P 500 companies and buy them on significant dips.  This works great because I get the benefits of a weighted S and P 500 ETF with the added benefit of market timing. So I'm timing the market so I can have time in the market. In four months, I'm up a little over 20% with this strategy.  However, in the last two weeks there have been like zero dips worth buying. Is it too much to ask that the market freaks out a lil over this ADP data? Papa's getting bored throwing miniscule amounts at short term options."

NVIDIA books “record demand,” pumps earnings, stock rips, then repeats with new partners. It’s a circular scam masquerading as growth, and it ends when the financing stops.  Analysts aren’t even checking credit quality. My bet: most of these customers are unprofitable, paying late, and propped up by NVIDIA to keep the illusion going."

It's Sparse Attention training procedure (something that Googles also pivoting towards) is just a gamechanger in efficiency, it's the closest we have to functional SNNs right now. And the efficiency shows in API token prices; OpenAI o1/o3 are priced at $15 per 1m tokens, Gemini 3 at $1.25 per 1m, Deepseek 3.2 at *$0.14* per 1m. Trained sparse transistors are also 2-3x faster on queries and use 40-60% less energy and RAM. If you're just asking a chat bot what the sore on your dong is this won't matter to you, but for API customers that are using AI for real shit, this is huge.  OpenAI's out here working on monster trucks that no one needs, Googles making practical sedans, Deepseeks making electric bikes. Efficient inference is going to be the end-all winner in AI, and OpenAI is sucking at that."

Along with its Q3 [results](https://sherwood.news/markets/marvell-technology-q3-2025-earnings-report-ai-boom-bubble/) released after the close on Tuesday, Marvell announced that it was acquiring Celestial AI for at least $3.25 billion in cash and stock, an amount that could go up by an additional $2.25 billion if Celestial hits certain revenue targets within roughly two years.  During Marvell’s earnings call, CEO Matt Murphy raved about Celestial AI’s ability to play a crucial supporting role in the AI boom:  >  What’s good for Celestial is presumably good for POET.  POET and Celestial are, loosely speaking, in different parts of the same business: [speeding the transmission of data using photonics](https://sherwood.news/markets/poet-technologies-ceo-dr-suresh-venkatesan-on-the-sweet-spot-for-the-optical/). POET is more upstream, offering the technology that enables these solutions, while Celestial applies this technology to its system for use in data centers.  Celestial was listed as a “customer” of POET in previous annual reports. Back in 2022, the two firms [announced](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/2022-feb-10) that POET’s key technology, its optical interposer, would be supplied to Celestial.  “The customized Optical Interposer platform that we have co-developed with POET is among the most advanced of its kind in high-speed computing,” David Lazovsky, founder and CEO of Celestial AI, said at the time."

It was the day after nvidia earnings and everyone was hyped. The news was positive. I waited till a little dip before entering spy calls fpr the month.   I sold my hedge a 660p and set an order for a new strike. I low balled it by a penny. I went outside and got into a huge argument with my girlfriend.  When I came back in spy went from plus 2% to minus 2%. My new put hedge didn't fill and was now up a few thousand percent. The put would have dwarfed my call loss. But instead I was down 40% on my new account.   I've recovered since. But my gambling port is about 10k off its high from 2 months ago. Luckily I bought some iren calls on monday. Hopefully iren is doing well. The news sure was positive on it all week.

Watch the spy chart and when it gets to below 35 rsi on the daily. That will likely be close to the daily low.   Once you pick your entrance into a 700c jan 2027 or later  then close your portfolio for 2 months. Spend that time reading books about the stock market and paper trading.

ns97h02,Upper-Difficulty660,1,1764860435.0,2025-12-04 10:00:35,"the risk to environment is zero so no japan no Ukraine and no us disasters. this is with a faction of the start up costs. the repair costs come after 15+ years including battery life for homes. no labor costs  as with nuclear these are just some off the top of my head I can think of. China's solar is installing more capacity than the rest of the world combined in the first half of 2025, according to [ember-energy.org](https://ember-energy.org/latest-updates/global-solar-installations-surge-64-in-first-half-of-2025/) and Electrik. The country added 277 GW in 2024, bringing its total cumulative solar capacity to over 1.13 TW by the end of September 2025. this alone can power 7 million homes. thats solar I haven't included wind. In the United States, wind power provides enough electricity to serve the equivalent of more than 46 million homes, according to the American Clean Power Association. The total electricity generated from U.S. wind in 2023 was enough to power over 39 million average American homes, with individual turbines capable of powering between 300 and 600 homes each. "
ns9a17d,Upper-Difficulty660,1,1764861240.0,2025-12-04 10:14:00,there are good articles comparing nuclear and solar you will see in the articles that labor cost continued 24 hr monitoring and start up and upgrades to nuclear are in the billions which far surpass that of solar. but you can check it out for yourself.

ns3jx45,CardiologistLarge523,1,1764782699.0,2025-12-03 12:24:59,that is a lie. the truth is you have hope they'll bounce back. you see the loss and not the remaining value. you lack respect for your money like you lack respect for yourself or you'd reposition it where it has a fighting chance or pull out until you find clarity instead of squeezing out the last bit of the ride on the hopium high you can get before the inevitable worthless expiration comes.      you'll make more money selling and putting it at a higher strike with a better delta but if i had to guess you wont do it. which is par for the course here and precisely what mms rely on you deciding to do.

Instead you see government subsidies and higher rates if you want a company that is partial or 100% renewable energy.  I agree that building out 50 year old nuclear designs that have proven unsafe is not a good idea either.  SMR's are too new to really even have a fact based argument so I won't bother, but I'm hopeful that they can prove safer and cheaper to operate than traditional designs with lower up-front costs."

Looking at big bank earnings same story, credit card charges have leveled off.  BNPL is a TINY industry still.  Here is the share of unsecured consumer debt by BNPL user type:  https://i.imgur.com/Ec9FWc0.png  From the CFPB report:  https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_BNPL_Report_2025_01.pdf  Bottom line people do use BNPL when they are tapped out of credit but it tends to be far, far smaller amounts vs. total consumer debt. The idea that this ""phantom debt"" is a hidden black swan is way overblown.  Richmond Fed also did a great report on this:  https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2025/eb_25-03  >Currently, the overall impact of BNPL on systemic risks is likely limited. In the third quarter of 2024, total U.S. household debt reached $17.9 trillion, including $12.6 trillion in mortgages, $3.2 trillion in combined student and auto debt, and $1.2 trillion in credit card debt. In comparison, the current market size of BNPL is relatively small."

I love the purchasing power I have here as an American. I love that I can buy a beer from 7-11 and get on a 30 minute subway ride all the way from one side of the city to the other.  I love the rural areas. I love their culture.  Fortunate to have been able to spend over a month of my life here (over multiple trips). Still have so much I want to see and do here. I usually spend ~4 days outside Tokyo and whatever time I have left in Tokyo (this trip I got to spend 5 days in Tokyo).  But it is so hard to get here from the east coast of the USA. Need to make more money so I can fly business class.  Maybe in another live I could move here long term. Sadly I own a business in the USA and can't be away for that long.

ns3j3ab,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764782460.0,2025-12-03 12:21:00,Is it sub $25k? You'll get flagged for being a PDT if so.  \---  What you can do is open a MARGIN account with $20k (or whatever you want) and lock it up into SPY. Then restrict yourself to $5k day trading capital. You won't get flagged as a PDT and will be allowed to trade more - since the account is over $25k.
ns3j7wk,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764782496.0,2025-12-03 12:21:36,Being said - your calls are likely fine now. I'm holding till high 683's then dumping again.
ns3gt4p,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764781800.0,2025-12-03 12:10:00,"ATM calls is akin to just betting on direction (up or down) since your entrance - within reason. If you get the direction correct, you're likely getting paid. I only look at the chart of the UNDERLYING when trading short dated options. I don't even look at the price of the option / their chart.  OTM calls is akin to betting on direction AND magnitude of movement. Payoff is higher if it hits - but I don't like making 2 bets in one. If you buy say $1 OTM and it moves up exactly $1 by EOD - your calls expire worthless whereas the ATM ones more or less breakeven.  \---  Basically ATM are lower risk / simpler bets. Just direction ""up"" or ""down"". OTM are ""up by N%"" or ""down by N%""  \---  ITM calls are ATM calls + a ""safety buffer"" / insurance. I don't like buying these often either as you can actually reduce an ITM calls play to a smaller EQUIVALENT ATM play that consumes less collateral but has the same payoff matrix."
ns3hyat,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764782130.0,2025-12-03 12:15:30,"If you're curious to view payoff matricies (rather than just follow price action) try plugging some plays into this: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)  I use it quite frequently. The long and short is that ATM calls / puts are strictly speaking trading directional risk. They're easier to trade / price if you simply want to make a bet ""this is going up by EOD"". No need to pick price targets or anything - like you do with OTM calls. It allows for variable change easier.  I often vibe trade - read what people are saying - do my own DD / vibe check / risk profile / etc. When dealing with ATM calls if the vibes change I can dump them without a second thought. For OTM ones - if I bet on ""up"" and it hasn't moved yet - they'll decay much quicker than ATM ones which retain more value. Things like that."
ns3xhez,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764786584.0,2025-12-03 13:29:44,For example - RDDT before ER's you could get a 7% premium for selling \~5% OTM CC's. Even tho ER's was more or less - flat - you'd have pocketed 7 fucking percent. Overnight. It's also up \~10% since ER's now too...
ns3xzu4,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764786728.0,2025-12-03 13:32:08,"It's a decent strategy if IV is high. If the options look too expensive to buy (to you) - that often means that shares + CC's is actually the winning strategy. You won't make massive 50-100%+'s like you see when you buy calls / puts - but you get a super high winrate with 5-10% gains. The largest loss I've ever taken via this strategy is \~4% overnight, the largest gain almost net 9%.  I've taken significantly more gains than losses, net of \~25% gains (at a guess) over the last few months on all the plays I've done with it.  \---  If IV is over 50-70, it starts to become ""acceptable"" territory to me.

I usually try to stick to 1 or 2 day trades a week, that way I don’t get flagged. I’m too scared to enable margin atm with the market being the way it is"
ns3hxbh,stefix96,1,1764782123.0,2025-12-03 12:15:23,well in you example it expires worthless if you just let it expire. otherwise you can sell for a profit on the way up  Thank you for your response
ns3c7gp,Mossad_psyop,2,1764780477.0,2025-12-03 11:47:57,For now im really only buying calls on SPY. Rather do shares on companies. I buy SPY calls 3 months out. Been burnt too many times on shorter dated calls on specific companies. Trying to build wealth not squander to gambling lol.

ns3rzqt,PaperHandsTheDip,2,1764785026.0,2025-12-03 13:03:46,"smart. I entered into puts, currently down \~20k on them. Kinda blows, but w/e. Max loss of \~40k. 683p's. Likely cooked beyond belief."
ns3vr3k,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764786097.0,2025-12-03 13:21:37,Margin accounts have a ton of benefits. The biggest of which is you don't need to wait for settlement to re-enter into trades. You can sell something and immediatley re-use the capital. I personally never actually dip into the margin on my account so I don't have to pay any fees for borrowing.   You only pay margin fees if you enter into positions larger than your collateral. I also have it so that I cannot buy options on margin - I can only buy them if I have enough collateral in the account. It kinda mimics a cash account without the settlement restrictions and gives you a lot more freedom to trade. Super useful.
ns3ii5n,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764782290.0,2025-12-03 12:18:10,"The difference is when the movement occurs. OTM calls decay much quicker if you go sideways for a while - whereas ATM ones do not. The greeks are different.  If you wait, say, 2hrs and don't get any movement / decide to bail - the ATM ones will retain more value than the OTM ones. If you hold all the way until EOD / expiration - then yah - not much differenence. It's mostly for intermediate trades / variable change.  Since I'm scalping (ideally short term trades) - I want my options to retain as much value as possible. I take profit where I can. ATM ones decay slower / retain more value -> better for scalping."

ns4eftr,OSRSkarma,2,1764791432.0,2025-12-03 14:50:32,Oh. Ya I’m usually happy for anyone making a profit and not being a retard and holding shit to 0 to prove a point
ns4dkow,beanstonks45,2,1764791181.0,2025-12-03 14:46:21,"and would you look at that, i got back from gym and turns out i shouldve held lmaoo"
ns4ddg2,beanstonks45,1,1764791122.0,2025-12-03 14:45:22,"i have margin turned on on both but dont actually borrow or take out margin, i have the immediate use of my cash once i close out positions, from what i understand, once i actually borrow on margin im suceptible to the interest that comes with it."
ns3jkt2,stefix96,1,1764782599.0,2025-12-03 12:23:19,"yeah yeah ofc, i forgot to explain i was referring exclusively to this day trading when market seems to swing every 15 minuty and volatility is high. otherwise i agree with you"
ns3ezfu,Mossad_psyop,1,1764781267.0,2025-12-03 12:01:07,CPB? 😂
ns3kq6i,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1764782932.0,2025-12-03 12:28:52,"Gotcha. Different ways to play the market. If you're just day trading with the EOD goal as your target with no intermediate swing trades / scalps - there is really no real difference. The only thing that matters is the delta between the underlying and your strike at EOD in that case. Multiply by number of contracts & 100 and that's your reward.  In your case - OTM makes perfect sense if you predict large movements. I always like the option to dump / swing interday (and frequently do - many contracts I only hold for 15-30 minutes). That makes ATM calls a wiser choice for me / my trading style. OTM calls make more sense if your looking at longer timeframes (ie: entire day), etc."
