AI is not automation; it is a time-saver; it will save workers ½ hr per day & increase the quality of their work, not the quantity of output.   Therefore, headcounts will not be significantly reduced by AI, yet the AI hype toots higher profits, but there will be little return on the $1.4T AI capex budgets & investors will be disappointed.  Nvidia is not worth $5T & its $30k-chip yielding a 70% profit margin won’t last.   Not to mention people will not pay a subscription fee for AI higher than their Netflix bill.   This is my rough math: $15/mo X 150M households is about 20B/yr in revenue to justify 1.4T in capex? AI can’t beat Netflix in revenue and companies won’t be able to significantly cut headcount. All said, NVIDIA is the biggest bubble since Lucent in 1999."

If you rotate out of big tech and confirm that it isnt worth its current value, its an admission that the stock market is just giga overpriced and no one should be buying this shit. Stick to your guns, either keep pumping your sham stocks or dump this bitch. SPY without big tech giga pumping is $400 MAX , so rotation aint gunna cut it."

Quantum RF receivers, quantum inertia gravity sensors, quantum atomic timing, and quantum computers with 1600 physical qubits, a commercial record. Cal tech achieved the world record 6400 physical qubits using Infleqtion’s glass cores. Neutral atoms is the most scalable modality of quantum computing, and is a serious contender in the quantum race.   Second most revenue in quantum behind only IONQ. They sell quantum hardware and sensors to the US DoD, NASA, Japan, UK, and more.  Partnered with NVDA as a founding partner of NVDA NVQLink. As Jenson Huang revealed at NVDA GTC, Infleqtion QPUs will be layered on top of the GPU-CPU AI datacenter stack to solve the most complex problems that exist.   Backed by same seed investor as Palantir and Anduril.  Same person that did the spac merger for OKLO.  When the merger is complete, the CCCX ticker will change to INFQ. Once that happens INFQ will be on par with IONQ IMO.   Right now it is valued less than half of Rigetti (lmao). It is undervalued currently due to the pre merger status."

After some chugging and ""choo choo"" a bit his mother heard it stop.  He said:  >All you retards who want off. Get the fuck off right now because now's your last chance.  If you stay on you're getting fucked in the ass.  Of course his mother lost it.  Spanked him a few times and sent him to his room for a couple hours to think about what he did.  She told him, ""we don't use that kind of language in this house!""  Later he came back out and starting playing with the train again.  >Ladies and gentleman, thank you for choosing us for your travels.  If you are disembarking, please take all your belongings with you.  If you are just boarding now, please properly stow your luggage properly in the designated areas above or below your seat.   The mother began to smile and thought that good parenting does actually work, and it can change how children grow up.

So instead of punting on miners or banks, they’re punting on whether these giant shed-full-of-computers will need heaps more juice or not. If they’re right, they make coin. If they’re wrong, they get pantsed. And because America sneezes and the ASX catches the flu, all this yank-level wizardry makes our energy stocks wobble like a kookaburra on a powerline."

Nike has a much easier time for continual EPS growth which is why they deserve the premium. IMO it's still cheap but is unlikely to have much upside for the upcoming quarter. A brand that needs to go to uncharted discount territory to reduce inventory is not something that will likely perform well short-term. Yes it's priced in, but losing companies usually continue losing. They will shed more margin until they slowly regain momentum. That said I own Lulu for long-term play and expect even worse this upcoming quarter. If P/E + growth is what you're looking for in apprallel, buy ANF even after this jump. ANF will continue winning."

FWIW I accurately called the dump on liberation day, despite others claiming it was priced in.  In this case, your concerns are poorly timed or overblown.  This administration will do ANYTHING to pump stocks.  The net selling of $67b is less than 1-tenth-of-one-percent of the $67.8 trillion in American stock market value. It's highly likely it's net selling to capture profits and lower their leverage. I don't know if you noticed or not, but markets were at ATH 2 weeks ago, and that's a good time to take money off the table.  6 of 7 major banks see climbing S&P in 2026.  Everything I listed earlier all but guarantees the market's value goes up in value. Absent a black swan event, or NVDA having a major miss, you're going to be praying for a drop for months, while stocks climb.   I'm going to stick to my beliefs."

The admin will do everything they can to pump stocks, but after a point, they have no cards left to play, and we are getting there.  From every angle, we are heading for a recession or are already there. Are you aware of the Hindenburg omen? Been triggered 5 times this year. Are you aware of the complete disconnect between AI and the rest of the economy. Are you aware of the circle jerk financing of AI companies?   Are you aware of the various bad loans made by private credit (starting with the First Brands bankruptcy), or Jaime Dimon talking about cockroaches? There are so many risk factors now, an.   I don’t know when the crash will be or if we will climb a bit before it (certainly possible). But in the next year, there are many, many risk factors that could create a black swan, and a black swan in such an unhealthy system can be…. impactful.   We don’t have to argue with each other - we can just play our own strategies and see how things shake out."

That being said, Nvidia produces hardware and have decades of engineering know how. Even if TPUs become more efficient than GPUs, it will be quite easy for Nvidia to pivot into a better semiconductor design. Google is like a transportation company whereas Nvidia is more like a railroad construction one, so to speak. "
