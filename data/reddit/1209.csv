When we pick losers and winners our winners end up losing and like Rome who died once the military was the greatest expense we now are there paired with abuse and fraud meaning for as many dollars as we send our military we won’t get the proper output needed to back our dollar by lead.  The abuse of the person that adds taxes in this country is coming to an end. That abuse was done with paper. Essentially the young generation that are value adders are rejecting this debt globally and turning away from government currency.  If we really are in another global reserve currency change silver will go to infinity if Germany is any indication so I’d rather have 70 ounces of infinity than one.

They have never transcended this, and turned their gaze to what is truly above, nor have they ever yet been borne there, nor have they really been filled with what is, or tasted pleasure that is certain and true.  Rather, like cattle, with a constant downward gaze, their heads bowed towards the ground, to their tables, they gorge themselves, feeding then mating, and, out of 586B sheer greed for all this they kick and butt one another with horns and hooves of iron. They slaughter one another with weapons of war because their desire is insatiable, since they are not filling the real part of themselves with things that are, nor are they even filling the part that can contain these."

nt51342,selfemployedsince16,2,1765299336.0,2025-12-09 11:55:36,I’m personally 80% silver 20% gold.  Hard to explain but no stocks are not better than gold. Diversification always seems to be safest.  You don’t want Yuan denominated assets either.  Owning silver and gold is like owning a global spy stock with much more bell weathering than any asset held in a currency like stocks backed in yuan or dollars.
nt51c2g,selfemployedsince16,2,1765299408.0,2025-12-09 11:56:48,Yeah I think you make a really good point. The day we stopped backing our dollar in gold we did it in lead.  Our cost per unit is so abysmal that it may show that china will beat us in 10 years due to cost of production of war.  Thanks for your dialogue.

This is based off the idea that the inflation that comes with lower rates will be acceptable because the increased liquidity will make companies keep people employed and people with jobs will continue to buy things so we don’t enter a depression. However most spending has been on AI, so the assumption that rate cuts will lower unemployment is suspect.   If your goal is just to cut rates, yes this is likely to cut rates.

I dipped out of most of my positions back in October when tec double topped, and doing so prevented what would have been pretty big losses at this point. Now, I have more money to invest.  Same idea as back in March. Sentiment was clearly shifting, which allowed for maintaining gains and buying into lower lows.  Also why my portfolio has been 80/20 Canadian/American, as opposed to normally being inverse of that. Canadian markets doubled Americas this year, and will likely continue that out performance. My gains this year have been substantial because of sentiment portfolio adjustment.  I'm 50% cash gang since October, and am better off than had I held. Though I may through 10-20% of that cash EoD incase there is a brief rate rally."

""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

nt5pp4e,selfemployedsince16,2,1765306932.0,2025-12-09 14:02:12,My main bet is the US is going to lose its ability to convince the global world to use its dollar so long as we push prices to infinity.   When we pick losers and winners our winners end up losing and like Rome who died once the military was the greatest expense we now are there paired with abuse and fraud meaning for as many dollars as we send our military we won’t get the proper output needed to back our dollar by lead.  The abuse of the person that adds taxes in this country is coming to an end. That abuse was done with paper. Essentially the young generation that are value adders are rejecting this debt globally and turning away from government currency.  If we really are in another global reserve currency change silver will go to infinity if Germany is any indication so I’d rather have 70 ounces of infinity than one.

We have a lot of options over here.  But I did some digging... There are very few Canadian individual stocks available for purchase in USD (mostly banks, and a few others), but I did find a few great index choices that hold the Canadian market.  EWC, FLCA, BBCA   All very identical. Hold most of what you'd want from the Canadian market. They're solid picks.  Keep in mind, I don't know the dividend tax implications by purchasing those.

Damn thanks for helping me think this through.  I don’t actually want collapse and catastrophe I just think the continual suffering of the masses is also unacceptable and a strong force will break it.   I don’t know anything that can fix the issues unless we debase from the current financial structures that are rooted in rot from the swamp that is the government.
