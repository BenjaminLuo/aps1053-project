He's still shorting PLTR with deep OTM puts that are 2 years to expiration.  Guy is incredibly smart.  But unfortunately the way he described the yield curve and what he thinks will happen, it's 100% obvious he just doesn't understand how modern Fed works or seems aware that Treasury also has enormous control over the yield curve.  The bear thesis from guys like Buffett or Burry.  All seem to hinge on one of two things:  * Taxes going up substantially or spending cuts.  Neither which are very remote possibilities currently.  * Rates going up or yield curve steepening magically under Powell, let alone Hassett."

Keep buying more contracts as the original contracts are worth 0. Step 5 pull half your savings out and fund your port Step 6. Buy a ton more contracts Step 7. Look at port and see that step 1 thru 3 are all at 0. Step 8. Watch as step 4 goes to 0 Step 9. Sell what little is left of your step 6 contracts for 1/3rd the price you paid for them.  Step 10. Watch as the stock finally does what you originally wanted it to do

Made HBO change it's name from HBO, to HBO Now, to HBO MAX, to just MAX, then back to HBO MAX, all while filling it with shitty reality tv. Just an absolute magician of hot garbage.

I've been settling to a frequency of about twice a month opening up the port and making adjustments. It actually works wonders to be able to not pay attention to whatever the market is doing every fucking second and just take it two weeks at a time. I will still look for investment opportunities by reading the news and watching the charts a couple times a week, but this surely has helped immensely to not stress about every minute little detail.

If you think your real estate or stock portfolio makes it ok you are probably wrong.  Measured in gold and silver every arm of the economy is in a depression.  Weimar took gold from being worth 180 marks to over 80 trillion marks for an oz.   Currency debasement is the real risk here. Not your stocks going up 17% in a year. Wake up.

That’s strong bearish pressure and shows: 	•	Sellers are active 	•	Buyers can’t push past resistance 	•	No reversal is forming  ⸻  📉 2. New LOWER HIGH → continuation pattern  You can see the sequence: 	•	Bounce to ~685.70 	•	Then a lower high around ~685.60 	•	Now dropping back to 685.38  Lower highs form right before a breakdown.  ⸻  🔥 3. Candles are shrinking = momentum fading before a move  This compression near 685.30–685.40 is extremely common before SPY:  ➡️ Retests the low of day ➡️ Breaks the level ➡️ Drops into the next support zone  It’s literally coiling.  ⸻  🎯 4. Key levels next  You’re sitting right above these: 	•	685.30 (micro support — almost gone) 	•	685.24 on your chart 	•	685.10 (LOD) 	•	Below that: 684.90 → 684.60 → 684.30  The chart looks like it wants to retest 685.10, and if that cracks, you get acceleration for puts!"

A 50bp cut would send us into orbit.    Bottom line - Lower rates allows consumers and institutions to borrow more money with more borrowing power, which in turn floods right back into the market.  It also just overall weakens the dollar due to more funds being injected, which causes stocks to go up since you now need more dollars to get the same return you were getting before."

The situation is that your money exists as something for them to take in their eyes, if you make money its akin to treason for the big players. There is nothing that enrages them more than poors making money. The powers that be honestly want the poors to lose money more than they want to make money, so with everyone mostly out of stocks and stacking puts the only way for that to happen is to pump to insane levels and then throw random -$5 Spy 5 min candles out all the time to fucking destroy call scalpers then destroy the subsequent put stackers thinking this will be the real drop. It will never be the real drop because a real drop right now will cause big boys to lose money and poors to gain, that is ILLEGAL. Instead they will debase your currency till its worth nothing and use Fed funds to in the fight to keep poors from ever having gains in a system designed to steal their money."

Hard-work paid off, but also to luck that I knew how to program when the tech boom happened. Was getting paid 2 minimum wage jobs cleaning fish and wiping behinds was very tough. Some of my CNA classmates who became my closest friends in life that became RN's were some of the most compassionate people i've ever met (Those Filipino women have tremendously big hearts). You really need a passion for helping people to stay in that job.     But i fully understand what you mean, Most of my batchmates never  had something close to the success i attained.

Price pinning is a real effect - it's not TA related. I don't even do TA to be honest. Pinning is a side effect of how MM's hedge options & manage the exercise risk around them.  686 seemed most likely due to the ranges it was trading today / where it was hovering - which meant to me the bet was positive EV that it'd likely revert / oscillate around there all day. I didn't do TA - it doesn't work well imo. I've never had any success with it.

The 51% attack by miners has become a little more real although there is no reason to believe that will happen.  It's definitely much more decentralized than fiat and more importantly, the ledger is completely public.  I think calling it either fully decentralized or centralized are both too vague.  It is still very resistant to government control or censorship.  Difficult to confiscate.  It still is used as a temporary off-ramp to fiat or intermediary to move money globally.  But yes it is not really currency you expect to use a lot normally, at least BTC.  That is fair criticism."

To do that - have a $10m+ portfolio (or that much in assets). I have things distributed around / a few companies / a home / other assets. I'd be perfectly fine covering it.  Basically - I could take this same bet everyday for almost 4 months straight, lose 100% every single bet, and I'd still have money left over. I only run 1 bet / direction at once.  \---  For comparative values - if you have a $100k portfolio, I'd be swinging with at most \~1k (or 5-10 contracts) at once. My net today was \~110%, which if you were swinging with \~1k (with a 100k portfolio) would have netted you \~1.1k profit (on 100k portfolio)"
