nr2v0fv,AutoModerator,1,1764262532.0,2025-11-27 11:55:32,"Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. ""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

nr46h9b,SaaSGrass,1,1764278018.0,2025-11-27 16:13:38,I’m telling it to you because you’re on an internet forum cheering about people being murdered and leaving their families behind. Classless liberal trash.

A world where you have free choice is a better world without some delusional religious freak telling women what to do with their bodies.
