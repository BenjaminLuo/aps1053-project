The only reason the market goes up is people are trying to protect against hyperinflation which a rate cut and QE will cause. But if white collar continues to get replaced by LLM’s, it will increase early withdrawals of 401k’s and decrease contributions. The debt load of consumers is already maxed. The bond markets are already downgrading. The private equity scheme is imploding.  The fed has lost control of everything other than sentiment. If the numbers are real and the economy is healthy, then the only thing a rate cut signals is it’s all a lie."

The Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, the third such cut, in an effort to support the stalling US labor market, which is showing signs of a rising unemployment rate (4.4%) and weak job growth.   Despite this easing, the cut is anticipated to be ""hawkish,"" with policymakers signaling deep divisions and a potential pause in further reductions due to inflation remaining above the 2% target, meaning future rate cuts are far from certain."

BNPL loans are often not reported to traditional credit bureaus so they create ""phantom debts."" A consumer may appear to have a healthy debt-to-income ratio based on their credit report while still servicing multiple BNPL loans.  Nearly 24% of BNPL users have missed a payment. Among Gen Z, this figure rises to 39%.  BNPL defaults often precede credit card defaults. Because BNPL plans are linked to debit cards or bank accounts, they drain the liquidity before the credit card bill is paid. 55% of users admit to spending more than they can afford. The real consumer default rate, if BNPL were fully integrated, would be significantly higher than Fed data currently shows.

The bird had earned its retirement in the cooking pot.  Chicken was lean, stringy, required long cooking, not particularly desirable. It was acceptable protein when the egg production ended. Nothing more.  1950s: The low-fat era begins. Saturated fat becomes the enemy.  Beef and pork are suddenly ""dangerous."" Chicken becomes ""healthy lean protein."""

This time they’re saying maybe no more cuts but he spent 10 minutes talking about downside risks to jobs markets and even when asked about his legacy he just talked about employment, didn’t even mention inflation. That’s as dovish as you can possibly get, I’ve never heard him talk like that. In previous meetings 90% of questions came back to focusing on inflation with barely any mention of jobs or if he did he just kept saying “strong labor market”, this time was the other way around and focus is on labor market weakness "

She does and they order a lot of stuff from them. Mostly disposables/consumable items but like a lot of stuff in the office.   She wasn't sure about large equipment purchases but  if it doesn't get ordered from their lab, then it comes from Medline. I asked if she thought the products were good or if people at the office complained about them. The answer was, yeah products are fine and no one hates them.   I asked if they often shopped around for other distributors or just worked with Medline. They do not constantly shop around or switch distribution.   Seems like a good business to me but I don't see this as a high flying crazy money maker play. Seems more like a safe-ish business. Bad for gambling probably good in economic troubles. That's my opinion, based on my wife's experience. Not really good due diligence but hey we are on wall street bets."

A naked call will fuck you in that situation, most definitely.  If you have 100 shares of SPY you purchased at $680 and you sell a $690 call for this Friday for $123, you're covered either way.  If SPY blows past $690, your shares get called away at a $10 per share profit ($1000).  If SPY doesn't go past $690, you pocket the $123 premium.  Or buy it back before then.  The only way you get truly fucked in this situation is if SPY plummets below your $680 cost basis.  Sure, you keep the $123 from the premium, but is that enough to cover the losses of it dropping to $675 or lower?  Sellers Create Volume."

But that shit is real. You need your own space and time. People are all different. Some people are introverts and just need space. Some people thrive on one thing after the next. So that family brunch, is energizing to them.  It gets tough because they want to see you and can get offended if you just stay home because you're ""tired"". You need a good excuse. Now how you draw that excuse is up to you. Be honest and potentially offend. White lie and it's a slippery slope. Or flat out lie.   Now you know why the serotype of some boomer ""going away for a work trip"" and it turns out they were at a cabin. Or ""I've got a work event"" to then go sit by a lake feeding the ducks. That shit is real and we kinda bashed it for being a bad person, boomer behavior. But idk. Maybe that person was just overwhelmed and needed space.   You could just talk to your SO, be honest and say, can you help me get some of my time back. ""How do you think I should do it"" see how that convo goes."

I don’t ever give anyone shit ever for not wanting to come to an event or gathering. Like no excuse ever needed for me I totally get it if you just decide you don’t want to. People have social anxiety I hate when people force social interaction.   But with that said I will go well out of my way or comfort zone to try to attend things that I don’t want to because of anxiety or tiredness. Mainly cause I hate the guilty feeling of not going cause you made some silly excuse  But financially I’m the only provider and if I can’t make something due to work obligations… like I don’t know how to respond if someone doesn’t completely get that like…. Are you going to pay my fuckin bills?"

Yeah for real I live in an incredibly expensive location (PNW) and it’s like I’m not living luxury over here. It’s like I’m screwing myself financially and with family time all because I want my kids to be raised by my wife and not the daycare or my mother. Crazy how difficult that is to accomplish nowadays I do truly make incredibly good money for my education level.   This gathering is actually the weekend before, I will still be able to see my parents and sister/brother and their kids on Christmas Eve and probably day too. So it’s like.. not that my extended family isn’t a priority if they all gathered on Christmas Eve or day id see them because I’m able to take that time off.

Iv missed out on plenty of stuff because I’m the sole provider of a family/household and it’s just the way things are currently.

So maybe that’s not so much fun to talk about but I’m not shy about sharing that info.   Yeah I’m the same way and my whole family knows that from me growing up. But now I’m a grown man and will do whatever I need to do regardless if I want to or not. But I feel like maybe they think I’m making excuse to just not go and that’s what gives me anxiety about it all because it isn’t like that but idk how else to get that message across.

ntb5h9z,chafingNip,1,1765383172.0,2025-12-10 11:12:52,Yep I did to my aunt and never got a reply. I think they are upset my wife won’t still load our newborn and 3 year old up and drive them over. The drive is over an hour and our newborn currently cries hysterically in car rides. But when I explained that is when I didn’t get a reply. Like am I supposed to force my wife into an uncomfortable and possibly even dangerous situation so you can see my family.  I get my kids are cute and people any to see them I want to show them off. But it just felt like I was making a poor excuse that they didn’t like hearing. But it’s the truth like dang. I really hate some aspects of the holidays the older I get.   Thanks for letting me talk this out it really does help my anxiety.

ntbe1qo,devnah721,2,1765385685.0,2025-12-10 11:54:45,"nah, volatility decay reads as daily rebalancing effects, which is working in the funds favor right now. Volatility decay means that if MU dropped 25%, you would lose 50%, and it would take a 50% gain (twice as much) in MU to get u back to even. Here it closed up last night. So consecutive up days should be more like 'volatility compounding' (a term I may have just invented) not decay :)         Like 20 questions into it with chatGPT... could be that Auth Participants aren't aggressively arbitraging its NAV... for various reasons. idk."
