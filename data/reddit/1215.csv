An OpenAI crisis could trigger a significant disruption, Kedrosky says: ""This whole interlocking structure just freezes solid."" If OpenAI falters, ""the foundations for the entire \[AI\] sector become fragile,"" Daleep Singh, former deputy national security advisor and current head of global macroeconomic research at PGIM, tells Axios. ""You have to think about the financial contagion."" Singh argues that Microsoft and Meta are rushing to buy chips to avoid being left behind.

I'm starting to think the opposite actually.  Kevin Warsh will be a lot more dovish and listen to Trump.  He's a lawyer with no training in economics  Hassett is a conservative economist with a PhD from Wharton, worked for McCain and both Bushes.  Worked for conservative think tanks.  Hassett might end up being a hawk.  Warsh is definitely going to pump markets more and he will win out.    Edit: Warsh odds soaring now on polymarket."

An OpenAI crisis could trigger a significant disruption, Kedrosky says: ""This whole interlocking structure just freezes solid."" If OpenAI falters, ""the foundations for the entire \[AI\] sector become fragile,"" Daleep Singh, former deputy national security advisor and current head of global macroeconomic research at PGIM, tells Axios.

November nonfarm payrolls figures are set for release Tuesday, along with October retail sales figures. These reports were delayed due to the U.S. government shutdown that took place in the fall.  Economists polled by FactSet are expecting the November nonfarm payroll data to show an increase of 40,000 on the month, which would mark a significant drop from the 119,000 jobs added in September.  The November consumer price index is due out later in the week on Thursday."

Buying at current levels is expected to continue for another few years.  Smart money also has yet to arrive, with a few exceptions.  There's hence a lot of potential upside for certain commodities and commodity miners within the next two to three years.  A few have posted DDs on commodities that turned out be fantastic plays.  Those have been largely ignored. though.  I've been meaning to write my own lengthy DD.  However, I'd much rather retail money not pile in so quickly during the current cycle, so I'll probably hold off on writing that for a few more months."

""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes, Waymo software is better now, but software can be improved on a monthly basis. And one cannot just lower the cost of the implementation since Alphabet buys cars from third party. Whereas Tesla manufactures their own vehicle and implements its own system. So if it comes to widespread FSD around the world, Tesla can scale up faster and cheaper than Alphabet. Its just a matter of time for Tesla FSD software to catch up to Waymo."

Congrats you made money gambling on PE expansion, I dont think Tesla moves on anything other than its a highly speculative stock with deep detivative markets.  If it was climbing on anything other than this it wouldn't be facing constant PE expansion.   Here is a clear example.  NVDA PE expanded on speculation of new revenue, the. Revenue materialized and investors were rewarded for their speculation as PE dropped to meet forecasts.  Tesla PE expands, the revenue never materializes and Musks promises you something new, and then some dumbfuck comes along and says ""tesla isnt a car company"", it is almost exclusively a car company. ""PE expanded and my calls printed"" is a technical trade based upon the pattern of what other investors are doing.  This is also why I dont bet against tesla. I just dont trade it, because it isnt a fundamental trade, its playing PE chicken with other traders. And you guys are levels of retarded not seen in markets before, so no point trying to outcompete."

The AI buildout is very real and the use case is proven with revenue to back this up. In Q2 increased CAPEX spend on AI was the most bullish thing ever for companies. Now in Q4, it's bearish. Market makers fed us a narrative that the debt raised by these companies is a concern. Meanwhile, everything NBIS has is sold and they are taking on debt to build more so they can sell more... it makes zero sense, but sentiment around the AI trade has clearly flipped and it's likely by design."

nu7k74d,kal14144,1,1765827866.0,2025-12-15 14:44:26,"The cost argument is somewhat overrated. Speed is more relevant.  Buying a Zeekr (as Waymo is going to be doing everywhere but the US starting next year) is actually about the same price as Tesla building its own car. The Hyundai built ones in the US will be a little more but not nearly as expensive as the custom individually retrofit Jaguars were.  But even if the cost was more, an average Waymo completes about 25-30 rides a day so over a few years the cost difference would only be a few cents a ride. The cost of cars is small in the grand scheme of things.  Speed is more important. Waymo does not yet have full production lines going. It is building them in both China and the US (with Zeekr/Geely and Hyundai respectively) but it’ll probably be a good year or 2 before it can start taking delivery of large volumes of cars. Tesla should be able to roll out cars quickly especially as its sales volume craters and its excess capacity can go to taxis."

nu6v6y3,Xannot,1,1765820656.0,2025-12-15 12:44:16,"Remember, market is price based on future expectations. So no, current revenue is not backing up the stock price now, it is price based on what investors think Tesla will be in the future. Waymo might be ahead now, but FSD is still in its early stage, its too soon to say Waymo had the monopoly over Robotaxi. In fact, GOOGL will face its own issue with Waymo in the future. GOOGL provides the software and LIDAR scanner, but they are not an automaker company.  They had to go around to different automakers, buy their cars and implement their system. This can cost up to 80k to 100k, while Tesla manufacture their own cars, and implement their system is only around 30 to 50k.  So if Waymo were to be widespread around the world, can you imagine the cost for GOOGL compare to Tesla? FSD software can be improve over time, but can GOOGL just venture into automaking industry? I don't think so.  Space X and Tesla will be correlated closely in the future as well, I have watched Elon propose plans to conquer Mars, and that's involving hundreds or even thousands of Optimus Robots to do the heavy lifting on the barren planet.   Astronauts will use cybertruck to maneuver around the rocky terrain and starlink will be established to connect Earth and Mars.  If you are an investor of Tesla (which I am, having a small position in it), you will want to be part of this journey, whether elon can deliver early is another thing, investors buys into that vision."

If you have access to the market order flow, then you'll see this.  Retail has accounted for a small fraction of precious-metals paper purchases and futures-contracts purchases this year.  I just want to avoid a manic rush of money at the moment so that I don't have to hedge so aggressively."
nu97rhy,therpgrad,1,1765847001.0,2025-12-15 20:03:21,"Also, the conventional wisdom that miners trade like a leveraged version of the underlying commodity does not always hold.  It's true in a lot of cases, since their underlying profits leverage to it.  However, that's not been the case for the last two years.  As a good example, back in 2024 Q2, the top gold miners, like Barrick and Newmont, had an average all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of around $1300/ounce.  The average price of gold in that quarter was around $2350/ounce, which is a difference of $1050/ounce.  Now, if we look one year later, at 2025 Q2, we can see the average AISC was $1420/ounce while gold was $3280/ounce.  So, gold had an improvement of around 40% YoY wheres the miners' AISC only changed by around 10% YoY.  We didn't see a big jump in those miners, though, until earnings season, so there was a significant leverage lag and thus substantial upside.  You can see, going back further, that these miners and collections of miners, like GDX, have significantly lagged due to being largely forgotten.  If you grabbed LEAPS early, even as recently as last year, then you would have locked in a 1100%-3200%+ gain for just holding a few months.  We're seeing the same story play out now.  A lot of the big miners took a bruising in October because gold was overbought during the 2025 Q3 run-up.  However, the miners themselves were not significantly overbought.  The ratio of gold miners (GDX) to gold (GLD) was only around 0.209.  This is below the biggest GDX-overbought periods in recent times, which were in 2020 (0.231) and 2016 (0.234).  The ratio we saw in October is closer to the long-term average (0.19).  As well, if you look the miners' AISCs now, they're around $1550/ounce, much of which is attributed to the higher royalty payments that are tied to the price of gold.  Some companies, like Agnico Eagle, still only have an AISC in the $1370/ounce range.  Their overall valuations remain low in certain cases.  So, as long as gold continues to either consolidate or rise from its current $4300/ounce range, then there looks to be a lot of potential upside going into February earnings period when 2025 Q4 results are reported for all of the main miners."

nu7k1vx,ImWellEndowed,1,1765827824.0,2025-12-15 14:43:44,Idk what you are working on or what models you use or when you gave up and decided to do it yourself so maybe you are right maybe you are just working off outdated info. I’ll never know. But I have conviction and I won’t stop buying tech if there’s a bear market because my time horizon is 15-20 years
nu5bdt9,215aPhillyiated,1,1765802875.0,2025-12-15 07:47:55,It’s been known we have a drug problem. You’re acting like this isn’t a problem around the world tho which I find funny. And our president is actually doing something to try and stop that poison from entering here.
nu5cm7o,215aPhillyiated,0,1765803381.0,2025-12-15 07:56:21,Lmao you must not know the rich people I know then because they fucking love drugs
nuke623,215aPhillyiated,2,1766001114.0,2025-12-17 14:51:54,You got me beat sir fuck
nu7kn9g,Intelligent_Map_8744,1,1765828001.0,2025-12-15 14:46:41,Proof of it didn’t happen. I got receipts on KitKat. I wasn’t aware of any recent FSD lawsuits? But keep talking. Also can you buy a Waymo? 
nu7hwsp,Intelligent_Map_8744,1,1765827180.0,2025-12-15 14:33:00,Yes the guy VW is partnering with to license his less self driving app is just some Chinese guy. Continue to speed run generational poverty. 
nu5azn5,jlw993,0,1765802713.0,2025-12-15 07:45:13,So you actively do the wrong thing because other people do. Doubling down on being wrong and calling me a retard 😂
nu5alcu,Mihermano2002,1,1765802545.0,2025-12-15 07:42:25,"Ah ur right. Yea I could see a contract boosting this up, I just wonder why they haven’t been called to be delisted since they’ve been maintaining under a dollar since their rally earlier this year. Ima throw a bit in there since it’s cheap asf too"
nu7wpvm,PaperHandsTheDip,1,1765831602.0,2025-12-15 15:46:42,Gotcha. I understand the value equivalences. I guess it's akin to selling a naked call. If someone exercises you just need to buy shares on the open market and deliver them

nu9fev1,Valkorion335786,1,1765849755.0,2025-12-15 20:49:15,Hmm… I guess it’s gotta be working…. Right?  In other news (I just hit 7 pull ups at the gym) do you think chips will ever be made in the US at scale?   I've got a two liter of Mountain Dew reserve l've been holding on to for when it happens….   *ThomasTheTankEngine.meme*

nu5genc,Icy_Jelly_315,1,1765804849.0,2025-12-15 08:20:49,"Yes, I said ""at 7 am"" for a reason"
nu7nf17,moorhound,1,1765828820.0,2025-12-15 15:00:20,"You obviously seem like an ""intelligent investor"", I'm sure you can google Tesla FSD lawsuit. Then you can take your pick of one of the $200m+ fatality settlements from this year, the California class action suit, the China/Australia suits, the hundreds of pending NHTSA cases, etc."
nu5b6xm,Fine_Specialists,0,1765802796.0,2025-12-15 07:46:36,Go cry about it retard. You’re worse then a woman woke up early in the morning to be grammar police and argue. The phrase is still often used in America so it’s not wrong. Get over it and go cry now little baby.
nu5awvs,NewSanDiegean,2,1765802680.0,2025-12-15 07:44:40,Check where they are listed

nu5daud,daedalus_dance,1,1765803656.0,2025-12-15 08:00:56,Europe is living rent free in his head because its living rent free in dear leaders head lol
nu5c3ue,215aPhillyiated,-1,1765803175.0,2025-12-15 07:52:55,Better then the last regard we had in office literally letting the smugglers walk right in and literally HANDING them money 🤡
nu7sm31,Intelligent_Map_8744,1,1765830376.0,2025-12-15 15:26:16,What’s the industry standard? Unless I see a B for billion I don’t think it matters. When I say industry standard how many lawsuits and payouts has uber had in that time. I saw a homeless dude sleeping in a Waymo this morning in a reel. You guys are fucked 
nu5bhtz,jlw993,0,1765802921.0,2025-12-15 07:48:41,Than* a woman that* woke up early

nu7u17g,moorhound,1,1765830805.0,2025-12-15 15:33:25,"Tesla's FSD settlements are, very likely, over the billion mark. They keep almost all of the settlement figures under wraps using NDAs, but the first one to go to public trial was settled in August for $243 million.  And this was for a fatality case from *2019*, to give you an idea of how many of these lawsuits are in the pipeline."
nu5bv7s,Fine_Specialists,1,1765803075.0,2025-12-15 07:51:15,Hey moron. Don’t you get it I could care less. I don’t give a fucc G. This iznt class homie. Get over it DAWG
