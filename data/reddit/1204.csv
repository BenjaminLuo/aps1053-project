Reality Labs incurred $4.4 billion in operating losses in Q3 2025, adding to $73 billion in cumulative deficits since 2020. This follows Meta's broader shift towards AI, including moving a top metaverse executive to AI oversight and cutting 600 AI roles in October 2025, signaling a pivot from metaverse ambitions."

Yet completely disregard recent spikes in the repo market and Japanese yields going ballistic indicating necessary rate hikes from the BOJ as clear signals of liquidity stress that will bring prices down. Reality is that today's market is just pure sentiment and positioning, market will move in whatever direction algos and CTAs want it to move in order for them to properly position themselves.   Anyone quoting rate cuts as a reason for year end rally is a moron, those are already priced in and institutional capital has know about it given WH push. Not saying we can't rally into year end, just saying that current mainstream narrative that we will definitely pump into Q1 due to incremental liquidity is a washed narrative and market is clearly waiting on something else otherwise we would already be pumping ahead of the meeting."

Do you even read?  >https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/july-2012/quantitative-easing-lessons-weve-learned  >Good definition from the St. Louis fed.  u/tquinn35  My friend, your own source literally says that targeting reserves is QE.  ""Traditionally speaking, QE is when a central bank goes from targeting interest rates to targeting the amount of excess reserves held by banks, i.e., the quantity of currency in the banking system. Central banks do this by buying financial assets in exchange for reserves.""  FYI here is where QE was actually first coined:  https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/340476/1/Translation_Werner_QE_Nikkei_Sep_1995_final1.pdf  But it has evolved to what I quoted with a broad range of potential goals beyond reviving a defunct credit system.  It's reserve targeting with asset buying and that's exactly what Fed will do very soon.  They will target higher reserves to ease conditions further.  Personally I think you've dug in your heels way too deep with an obsession on semantics to think objectively about what is going on here.  You think things will be stagnant next year.  Let's revisit next year July and year end.  You will see that you're very wrong on your forecast."

Yea maybe if you didnt have a Wallstreet Skynet that can perfectly manipulate options with information about everyone's position and Federal Reserve backing I would believe that. Fact is the indicators mean nothing anymore because the market is no longer the result of an aggregate of humans buying and selling stocks. Its all options driven algo manipulated fugazi and all the shares are being traded 10x for every one in existance just like they do with fractional reserve banking dollars. Skynet just trying to hit its KPI's type shiii.[](https://dn720006.ca.archive.org/0/items/baudrillard.-1970.-the-consumer-society/Baudrillard.1981.Simulacra-and-Simulation.pdf)  [](https://dn720006.ca.archive.org/0/items/baudrillard.-1970.-the-consumer-society/Baudrillard.1981.Simulacra-and-Simulation.pdf)

Motherfucking TIM WALZ. In the flesh. Wearing a Carhartt jacket, Vikings cap pulled low, trying to act casual while holding the biggest black strap-on I’ve ever seen (we’re talking 12-inch “Destroyer of Worlds” level, veiny, glitter edition).  I shit you not, this man was comparing two of them like he’s at Home Depot picking out drill bits.   He turns to the clerk (tattooed 22-year-old with purple hair) and goes, in that exact folksy dad voice:  “Yeah hi, does this one come in ‘Minnesota nice’ or is it only available in ‘Midwestern guilt-trip’?”  Then he grabs a bottle of gun-oil lube, a Kamala 2024 butt plug (rainbow edition), and what looked like a puppy-play tail in progressive-pride colors. Paid cash, no eye contact, muttered “I'm high T” and bolted.  I’m literally shaking typing this."

Shareholders can look forward to new revenue flowing in, additional leases being signed, and groundbreaking on new sites. I also appreciate the focus of our CEO on delivering on time capacity and also his resistance to diluting share holder value by offering Senior notes recently.  It sure looks like Kevin Hassett will take over for Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also, it is being reported that Scott Bessent may also take up the position of Head of the NEC. Will we have rate cuts December 10th? You betcha, and a rising tide floats all boats. This will allow attractive financing rates for any and all, a kickstart for economic activity. This includes our suppliers as well as customers. I added to several positions this morning, APLD, BW, and SEI in preparation for the coming six months and year.  I anticipate some very positive press releases as well as earnings from all three in the next six months (or sooner for APLD), especially our Darling, APLD. Happy Thursday and Best to All. 💎"

What I have been saying this entire time is QE = reserves PLUS long duration asset purchases with intent to ease financial conditions not just reserves.  u/tquinn35  Since you hide everything that you post it was hard to find but here it is:  >The floor/ample reserves system isn’t “easy money,” it’s stability. Maintaining ample reserves is not the same as executing QE.    Maintaining ""ample reserves"" is targeting reserves.  They will print money to target higher reserves next year.    Ok you are getting way too emotional.  Let's see if we can find common ground and clarify what we agree on.  * They will turn on the money printer next year, without a crisis.  I think this is established.  * Targeting reserves is QE as per St Louis Fed.  * Next year they will begin the process of targeting higher reserves to ease conditions and they hinted they will do over a long duration as the economy grows.  Which meets your definition of QE.  Hence they will do QE next year."

Their IT department did a fake scam email to all employees after doing training on avoiding scams to see if people paid attention.   The my sent an email saying it was a $25 Amazon card for employee appreciation.  Had to click a link.   Enter you work emails username and password. Then personal info.       Most people deleted the email or only opened the email before realizing it was sketchy.    But like 3 people went all the way through and entered personal information.   They were pissed when they found out they fell for it.  Then like 2 months later IT did a similar one again to see if the results improved.  They did not two of the 3 same people went all the way to the end lol.

""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

ns9xv2i,tquinn35,0,1764868228.0,2025-12-04 12:10:28,">My friend, your own source literally says that targeting reserves is QE.     Please quote me where I said differently that you loon. What I have been saying this entire time is QE = reserves PLUS long duration asset purchases with intent to ease financial conditions not just reserves.     Also I am not your friend, I actually think you're a giant clown.  >FYI here is where QE was first coined:  >[https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/340476/1/Translation\_Werner\_QE\_Nikkei\_Sep\_1995\_final1.pdf](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/340476/1/Translation_Werner_QE_Nikkei_Sep_1995_final1.pdf)  >But it has evolved to what I quoted. It's reserve targeting with asset buying and that's exactly what Fed will do.  What does this have to do with anything? Did I question the provenance of the QE? No I didnt. I am quite aware where it came from.  https://preview.redd.it/735audnvy75g1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec4c82c86b0c5e719fdd3f12baac13488dd1f493  Since you're not editing and deleting what you said let me add this screenshot for posterity.  You said it had no formal definition. I said the Fed maintains a pretty strong definition as presented by the st. lous fed.  While the definition has changed since Warner introduced it, it is still defined.  Also you clearly cant read cause the entire point of the fortune article is that Warner is criticizing the modern use of QE and suggests that it should be not good for the economy to keep using that way. How does that support your idea that we will continue using QE?  >Personally I think you've dug in your heels way too deep with an obsession on semantics to think objectively about what is going on here.  Please tell what semantics I have dug in on. You have provide zero actual factual evidence backing up any of your claims. And apparent from above, have often times presented  contradictory facts to your arguments"

However, the export of high-end AI and supercomputing chips is heavily restricted by US law, leading to both legal and illegal shipments. Some high-end cards are legally sold in China with ""neutered"" specs, while powerful versions are sometimes smuggled through unauthorized channels or re-purposed by Chinese factories for other uses.  Manufacturing and shipment Global design, Taiwan fabrication: NVIDIA designs its chips worldwide, but the actual silicon fabrication is done by companies like TSMC in Taiwan. Chinese assembly: Chinese companies are responsible for assembling the final product, including the cooling solution and printed circuit board, and sourcing many of the components. Shipping from China: Some graphics cards are legally shipped from China to other regions, including the US, sometimes to avoid tariffs, as shown in this TweakTown article."

You can hedge it with a cheap put or vix call. Just in case we get a huge crash. Just pick the hedge 10% below the current price and 6 months out.
ns8w6cc,mhughes2595,1,1764856661.0,2025-12-04 08:57:41,"That depends. If you want a safer contract that follows spy then you can get a deep in the money call. Like a spy 650c jan 2027.   If you want more risk and reward, then a 10% otm 1 year out is a good idea as long as you time your entrance well. Spy goes up an average of 10% per year. Spy ends the year in the green 70% of the time.   If you choose the otm option it will be cheaper but you need to hedge it. You will want a 10% otm put 6 months out. Just do research on how to manage a hedge. It's complicated."

nsbpdb0,Happy_Discussion_536,1,1764887124.0,2025-12-04 17:25:24,Why hide everything on your profile just curious.  You said QE is duration buying which they will as well.  In fact they are already doing that as we speak with rolling Treasuries towards duration that is at odds with duration of outstanding.  Please tell me you know this lol.

""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

nscs63k,Happy_Discussion_536,1,1764900738.0,2025-12-04 21:12:18,"Look seriously.  I'm not trolling.  I'm not a bot.  Can we at least agree that they will print money next year to target a higher level of reserves?  And it fits both definitions of QE that you provided?  Honestly you've said so many things at this point I just want to know what you actually think.  Are you saying they *won't* print next year?  Because that's a very different statement.  I disagree but a little more comprehensible.  Let's put aside the back forth, what do you really believe?  >Quantitative easing (QE) is when a central bank creates new base money and uses it to buy financial assets, mainly government bonds, from the market. That newly created money enters the banking system, increases liquidity, and expands the central bank’s balance sheet.  That was your definition you gave in another comment.  And Fed's definition: https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/july-2012/quantitative-easing-lessons-weve-learned   >What Is QE?  >Traditionally speaking, QE is when a central bank goes from targeting interest rates to targeting the amount of excess reserves held by banks, i.e., the quantity of currency in the banking system. Central banks do this by buying financial assets in exchange for reserves. Conventional monetary policy also requires buying and selling assets, namely short-term debt, to influence the desired interest rate, but the difference with QE is that the level of purchases—and not the interest rate—becomes the target."
