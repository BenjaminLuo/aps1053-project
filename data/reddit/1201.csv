Supply-chain checks now point to about 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028, far above earlier estimates.  Every 500,000 TPUs sold could add around $13 billion in revenue and $0.40 to EPS. With Google planning 12 million TPUs over two years, analysts see rising potential for external TPU sales alongside Google Cloud’s AI demand. The improved outlook also helped justify Morgan Stanley’s upgrade of MediaTek to Overweight"

As institutions that can’t buy Bitcoin directly capitulate into MSTR, the stock could begin trading at a 2–2.5× NAV “Saylor premium,” effectively turning it into a leveraged Bitcoin holding company plus a high-growth Bitcoin financialization platform. Would not be impossible for it to command a $8,000–$15,000 per share within the next few years."

nrpgph4,Putrid_Pollution3455,2,1764595937.0,2025-12-01 08:32:17,"They’re actually simple debt instruments and learning about them is important but super boring. You borrow money from a country with low interest rates to buy bonds from a country that has higher interest rates and a more powerful currency. Interest rate arbitrage. When the country with low interest rates increases their rates the profits go away and all the debt used to pump up the bonds of the country with higher interest rates gets a massive sell off in their treasury market. Something like that.   Example borrow at 0% to buy bonds yielding 4%. Nice profit. Your loan of 0% goes up to 4% or higher suddenly it’s not worth messing with or worse you could go upside down if rates go up too quickly  Useful dynamic to know: when bonds sell off the rate goes up and vice versa. Look at our long term treasuries TLT. When institutions start selling off TLT the face value goes down and the yield goes up. If we cut short term rates to zero but inflation expectations go up, investors need yield sufficient on the long term rates to justify purchasing them or they sell off."

That's it. That's the entire fucking game. You escape inflation by buying assets. You DO NOT SELL assets in exchange for dollars, not when the dollar is in a death spiral."

I still don't think treasury companies make sense, but I don't think this says much about BTC up or down. The issue BTC is having is that its underperforming right about when the four year cycle theory says it should, and that can quickly become self fulfilling with long-term holders. This then triggers leverage, treasury co issues etc. I don't think the trend reverses for a while without a black swan event (eg Trump announcing something), but eventually bitcoin will find a new narrative."

nrpi7df,Putrid_Pollution3455,1,1764596488.0,2025-12-01 08:41:28,Yes in a nutshell that’s what is happening.   Well when long term loans like houses and autos goes from 6% to 12% what do you think happens? Buyers can’t afford it so demand gets destroyed until prices come down or rates come down. Lots of cash buyers in that market and cash buyers need a deal. That’s why they are pushing for 50 year mortgages it would make your monthly payment cheaper. But the real solution is to ax 30 year mortgages and destroy demand for prices to collapse. 😂 something at some point will get destroyed could be anything that relies on long term financing. In this case it could be the treasury market itself getting destroyed. Which means the money printer cometh. At some point we get horrible deflation in houses and autos and government loans skyrocket in rate until it stabilizes or the feds come in to fix the implosion. The consensus is we can’t afford a deflationary crisis with our already rocketing budget deficits so the only solution is currency debasement; when they start QE we could see insane inflation on everything
