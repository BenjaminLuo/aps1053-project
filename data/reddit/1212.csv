What’s driving the selloff today (Fri **Dec 12, 2025**) looks a lot like a **tech/AI de-risking day** more than a “whole-economy is breaking” day:  * **Broadcom shock → “AI trade” gets hit.** Broadcom’s outlook (especially **lower margin expectations tied to AI systems**) spooked investors and reignited “AI bubble / valuation” fears, which spilled into chips + mega-cap tech broadly. [Reuters+2Financial Times+2](https://www.reuters.com/business/nasdaq-sp-500-futures-slip-broadcom-outlook-reignites-ai-bubble-fears-2025-12-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * **Oracle weakness adds fuel.** Oracle’s recent miss/forecast issues and data-center headlines have been part of the same “AI infrastructure” sentiment hit, contributing to the pressure in tech. [Financial Times+1](https://www.ft.com/content/8b9519df-9154-4eb5-ab3b-d3da0115b65e?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * **That’s why Nasdaq is worse than SPX-style exposure.** In the pricing snapshot, **QQQ is down more than SPY** (tech-heavy vs broad market). * **Macro backdrop = cautious risk-taking.** Bonds have been soft (yields a bit higher), and markets are also looking ahead to **delayed economic data** releases after the government shutdown disrupted the normal calendar—so some “profit-taking / lighten up” behavior is amplified.

A few weeks ago it was dumping because of liquidity fears while the market continued to rip, this makes a little sense since crypto is so closely tied to liquidity. Today, liquidity is once again flowing and improving with fed intervention but data center story is once again enough to dump crypto which should have nothing to do with it. It’s just a proof point that crypto and even metals for that matter, will not care if there is a contraction in equities due to AI underperformance."

Japanese yen was available at near-zero interest rates for years.  You could borrow it and then invest it and pocket the difference between the return and the interest.  This is the ""carry trade.""  What is going wrong?  The Bank of Japan has been trying to normalize the rates.  It tried in August 2024, leading to a sudden ""carry trade unwind"" where borrowers have to undo their investments and pay back their yen.  The exchange rate is part of the equation as well.  If the yen suddenly weakens against other currencies, your investment gains can be wiped out by the currency exchange risk.  The new government has pledged to spend more, which means some inflation pressure, which means more rate hikes incoming.  It's not the only factor for the drop, but I think it does explain some of the more speculative assets unwinding first, and now the next wave (more recent AI gainers)."

Broadcom and AMD have P/e's over 100 and cisco had over 100 p/e too when it was the dotcom era lol. funny. ppl think nvda is done and then they overvalue companies not doing as good. Although Broadcom actually has much higher growth than AMD  but Ive never seen a more overvalued stock than AMD.

It's all just a scam, but everybody is involved and everybody makes money...the higher the price of the vehicle, the less likely you are to be able to buy it out right.  The banks make money because they are the ones lending the money, and the dealership/car manufacturer makes more money, because the banks give them a kick back for choosing them to finance the vehicle.  It's the same with housing, housing is fucking wicked expensive because they NEED you to not be able to buy it out right, because nobody makes money.  Also, housing needs to stay expensive, because they need to have a reason for people to work.  If a house cost 10k, nobody would work.  Same reason appliances and the like don't last longer than 5 years....keeping the regular joe financing everything.  It's all a ploy to keep people working, feeding the system of greed."

""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then I paper traded for a few months to make sure I saw similar results before committing real capital.  Worth trying if you haven’t tested it out like that yet. I used TradingView market replay and did it manually with daily charts - took forever but was worth it. I wouldn’t trade any system that doesn’t make it through a thorough backtest with solid performance and risk metrics.

But like you’re implying the entire economy is banking on AI which thankfully does have tons of potential and real utility so none of this is likely to be anything but short term pain. If a “bailout” occurs I don’t think it will be labeled as such. Likely will be labeled as a “investment” from various entities (including the government) which I truly do believe will eventually pay off. As long as OpenAi can retain their frontier models and keep up with delivering to both B2C and B2B adoption and the money gets spread to mega corps the cycle will continue

Depending on how much time premium you have and how far out of the money they are, you can still have 5-10X, potentially even more leverage on your dollar than shares. It’s called risk management.  Why risk 100% of your investment for a 10-30% scalp when you can easily get that from scalping leaps, where you have to ability to hold for a month and wait, or cut your losses after a certain point? You have way more room for error."

nts212t,Pretty_Ad_7885,1,1765609264.0,2025-12-13 02:01:04,Good for you. Just remember that there was a guy who maxed out his credit cards and debt to buy doge coin and was up several millions dollars. Everyone was shitting on him as well. He thought all are idiots for telling him to sell and he was right for a long time. But he never sold and look at him now

ntn2n66,damnthatbooty,2,1765545580.0,2025-12-12 08:19:40,I think it’s more the fact that they have no risk management and also they just kind of do something and go. Oh wait to go up and then just get extremely lucky but that’s when they lose like 90% of that anyway.
ntn3aht,Alone_Duty_9448,2,1765545816.0,2025-12-12 08:23:36,2 years ago i was up like 50% and now im down 90% trying to reach even in the end of the year🤣 at least the taxes are not a problem 🤣
