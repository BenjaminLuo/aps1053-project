Housing, food, even owning stocks (more needs) should underperform concert tickets and precious metals (universal wants) this is a good thing.  I bought a lot of silver and gold this year arguing that it was an undersubscribed to asset class. If Spy is risky because it is American tech, silver is safe because it is used in all tech in any country.

They did that all the way to 1300 by fomo farming, forcing positive gamma and their fake earnings guidance for ""double revenue by 2030"" with zero indication how that would happen. Last earnings it became apparent there is zero evidence their revenue will even go up by 2030, so the descent started. They had to throw the stock split out to get ANY buyers of this toxic asset to step up and also so that they pay out less on put options on the way down and the negative gamma cant build on itself so much. Thing is even THAT didnt work, still no one buying this trash lol. So now they are drumming up stories and uncertainty to get people in so they can dump some of these toxic shares that wont stop drilling down. Hope that clears it up for you."

(i.e. small dump after their bid because they gotta spend money and stock may be diluted; bigger dump after hostile bid bc they may have to make an even higher bid, may face antitrust action, and are on Republican bad side)"

nsympn4,fire_alarmist,1,1765212635.0,2025-12-08 11:50:35,You mean when they turned off half the internet to reduce trade volume to a manageable level because they were so nervous it would finally break and they couldnt hold it? When retail got locked out and couldnt adjust their positions as a last hail mary to prop up the scam market? The one where SPX options trading got turned off and even when it was on the options prices were pinned and so fake you couldnt execute a buy for $500 over the highest bid or a sell for hundreds under the ask? Yea I remember that day.

But hopefully WBD holders are not stupid enough to reject the generous NFLX deal.  They get a way better offer.  They get $23.25 in cash + $4.50 in NFLX stock (very undervalued) + they still get to keep the new Discovery company.  With the pesky Paramount deal they get $30 all cash only. Which is just $2.25 more for Discovery.

nsy3u5b,[deleted],3,1765207017.0,2025-12-08 10:16:57,"I met Jerome Powell at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Jerome Powell shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Powell was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Jerome Powell and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents."

CVNA float is only at like ~140M Shares, and roughly 55% is owned by institutions so there’s realistically about 63M in loose float. Indexes are going to need to buy about 15M shares alone, plus another 3/4M??? Maybe for hidden indexes + covering short interest is another 2/3M shares. You’re looking at 20-25M shares needing to be purchased off 63M shares available, the last ten minutes of the day on 12/19 when indexes start buying is going to cause a price swing upwards, and if float is really that tight it may be by a large amount  Check out the post by u/dowgy"

Give it two years and their fixed overhead (unused facilities, co-manufacturing contracts) run out and their margin goes to 30%. That's more price flexibility and more profit.   If they don't get delisted or bought out, it's a guaranteed bounce-back to $10-15 within three years."

It's a guaranteed turnaround IMO if they don't get delisted, which would be very surprising... Within two years, their margins will grow to 25-30% (from current ~7%) because the contracts on their underused facilities are expected to run out. It's either to ~$10-15 or a buyout.

Now us regards are betting on the AI to see if it's a bubble or the thing that makes human labor obsolete, and no one has considered or gives a damn what will happen if people can't get jobs to pay the bills for homes/apartments meaning the housing market could collapse since noone can pay the mortgage."

nsxrpai,Traditional_Page_75,5,1765202993.0,2025-12-08 09:09:53,"Grandpa spent one year in the mines @18. Followed his father in. After a mine collapse and layoff he moved to California. Wood product mills until he was 55. 83 now. Buys a new car every 2-3 years.   Interestingly, he’s the only male in my family without a “God fuck back at the mill when I worked so hard at the mill” complex. Their complexs are getting worse, too.. anyways, grandpa always remained humble. And moreover, positive.  What’s more, he said once that when he was a boy, he never expected to own his own home. Dirt poor, rural America in the late 40s-early 50s. No shoes kind of thing.  Something to be learned from those kinds of people about the life you have, and operating in it. Definitely an unlearned trait nowadays. But, he bought a home at 20 for less than 20k. Dad his slightly below 90. Mill jobs payed over 15 an hour then. Now a home is 400 and there is little chance at opportunities for a quality salary and security. So I get the plight of young people, though lack of gumption is a quick death.  Older generations who dwell on how hard they worked, how much they achieved, and how little the young have to are agonists. In that same time, their peers could work a few days here and there and live fine. Rock and roll, endless parties. $50 a month for a room in a multi unit house downtown, minimum wage 4 dollars an hour …. Truly different times.  Boomers who bent their head down and worked decades of their lives away for a few houses look back at those people. And they don’t understand zoomers and alphas have to pay 2/3rds of full time income for housing. Which is slavery."

Took 80% profit in 4 years which isn’t bad.  But few I can deploy it elsewhere for better returns.

Over the last 12 months it paid out $10 in dividends. Also over the last 12 months the stock's price dropped to $1. So on a trailing 12 months basis, it paid a 1000% dividend yield. But right now I have the $10 in dividends that it paid me, plus a share of stock worth $1. My current holdings are worth $11.  But hey I don't know how this is all gonna get calculated.   All I know is, the MSTY stock price went down a lot, and when I look at this table of cash payments, they also went down a lot: [https://stockanalysis.com/etf/msty/dividend/](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/msty/dividend/)"

I don't think we have the same model here, as a single actor like Jane Street being able to move the market by dumping/pumping underlying share is much more difficult here.  I do however believe it shows that the value of the derivative market far exceeds the underlying, here I think this manifests in the PFoF arms race. Being able to watch the flow of the option market in real time is the name of the game now.  To this extent I don't see it so much as systemic manipulation, as I see it as systemic risk where funds and dealers are incentivized to keep movement and volatility high as that is how they extract value from the market now and underlying holders effectively get to be unwilling collateral in this game."

AFTER it would tell us something if there is a sudden surprise.   If there's a big sell off after FOMC and there's a lot of volume, buy that dip.  If there's tons of volume and green, be cautious as it could be bearish.  Definitely don't lever long.  In short, volume only tells us what people did in response to known information.  It doesn't tell us what will happen to new developments.  But if you don't expect anything big to happen at Wednesday (Fed actions), yes low volume would be bullish.  Low volume just means there hasn't been a big change of hands and opinion.  So if the direction is grinding up that's good."

TA isnt a fucking foolproof method, its a set of clues you are supposed to take in as a whole that allows you to make a thought in one direction or the other.

Its not magic, it can be wrong, but it exists for a reason. It allows you take in information all around the asset, such as volume, trends, condition, and make an EDUCATED GUESS as to where it will go.     Let me give you a little advice, if you stop overleveraging and actually use your money properly, entering positions based on TA and giving yourself space to DCA, youll be glad to use TA.

Its 2 different things.  You shouldn't be overleveraging to the point that SPY dropping 30% would kill your port. If you cant afford 60k for SPY csp, with that being a small percent of your port, I dont recommend it, yet I dont understand how that would make you lose if conditions are met?  If you continue collection premium through a 30% dip, and continue selling on the rip, youll have more than youd have just sitting watching in a HYSA."

While we spend more on bank fees than our military this sure isn’t going to end well.   The future generations ability to pay said debt dwindles as they are forced off of the stakeholder capitalism group which will necessitate even more printing when they don’t pay the bill.

So if I understand what you're saying correctly - there was the big dump on NVDA earnings day (high volume likely indicating there was a lot of accumulation going on by bulls while bears sold into their hands). And this low volume melt up has been the market making its way back up to a point where there will be disagreement again (meaning that there was widespread agreement that market should go up from nvidia earnings day until today).
